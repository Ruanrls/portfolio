# About

The zero date is a real-time video call application between two people.
The goal is for people to get to know each other and talk about different subjects and in the
end of the call, if they want, they can exchange contacts to continue the conversation in
another moment.

## Challenge

The biggest challenge was implementing real-time calling. Dealing with disconnections and dealing with
connection failures was a challenge, mainly due to the fact that several pieces of information
should be collected during the call.
