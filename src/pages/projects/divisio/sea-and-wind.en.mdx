# About

Sea and wind was one of the coolest projects I've ever worked on,
it consists of a social network for 'sailors' (people who
enjoy sailing), where they can share their experiences
and also find other sailors to sail together.

## Challenge

Creating a social network is a very complex task, there are several
Hidden functionalities that help the functioning of the application.
The three biggest challenges were:

- Creation of the feed. (Feeds are customized accordingly
  with the preferences of users, in addition, handle and treat thousands of posts
  is a complex task that requires caution).
- Creation of an interactive map. (Interactive map, with the possibility of
  visualizing demarcated places and tracing routes is something very complex).
- Video processing. (Time-lapse video processing
  real ensures it falls within the submission rules and is optimized
  to the platform).

During this project, I also had the opportunity to lead a team
with 4 other developers, which was an unforgettable experience.
