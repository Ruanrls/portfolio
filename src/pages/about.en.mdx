# My story

I grew up surrounded by electronics, always curious to understand how they worked.
From a young age, I knew I wanted to work in the field of technology, which led me
to attend **Computer Science** 👨🏻‍💻.

During my teenage years, I learned the fundamentals of programming, which further
sparked my interest in the art of "communicating" with machines 🤓. It was also during
this time that I discovered the web development area.

Throughout my experience, I have had the opportunity to work on incredible projects,
ranging from systems for investors 📈 to social networks 📱 with real-time image
processing and content.

In addition to working on challenging projects, I also enjoy exploring new technologies
and tools on my own. Whenever possible, I dedicate time to learn about new frameworks,
languages, patterns, and other technologies.

Throughout my journey as a full-stack developer, I have learned the importance of
collaboration and teamwork <span className="inline-block">🤜🤛</span>. Working on complex projects requires a collaborative
approach, good communication, and planning.

Even today, at 22 years old, my goal is to continue improving my skills, learning new content,
facing new challenges, and creating increasingly complex, innovative, and high-performing
solutions.
