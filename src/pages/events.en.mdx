### Tech talks
During the time I worked in the division I had the opportunity to participate and teach TechTalks.
I presented to my teammates an introduction of writing tests, unit tests and how to use mocks, 
stubs and spies. I've also presented the concept of TDD and how to apply it in the development of
applications.
 
> TechTalks are video call events where the focus and discussion on some concept
> or important technology in the area, the exchange of information and passing experiences
> events is extremely important for the professional growth of everyone involved.

### Mini-course presentation (JECT)

During college I taught a short NodeJs course for students
of the Computer Science course at the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais - Formiga.

During the short course, a CLI application was developed to manage tasks in memory
using good market practices and writing clean code.
